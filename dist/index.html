          Learn by doing! A service safari is one of many tools used by service designers to help make the services we use more functional, easy and desirable. This experiential field trip will help you better understand how services feel from the perspective of the user.

            <strong>When:</strong> Tuesday, April 26  4-6pm<br>
            <strong>Where:</strong> We will meet across from the Morial
            Convention Center at the corner of Julia St. and Convention Center Blvd.<br>
            <strong>Duration:</strong> 2 hours. We will be walking approximately two miles during our safari, so wear comfortable shoes!<br>
          </p>

          <p>
            During this two hour session you will be introduced to some
            essential service design techniques: the POEMS framework
            (People, Objects, Environments, Messages and Services) and 
            3-12-3 brainstorming. The Smashing Boxes Service Safari will be 
            broken into two components each lasting about an hour.
            Field work: We will go out in the field. We will apply observational 
            methods as we encounter the various touchpoints that make up a 
            particular service — the people, information, products and physical 
            spaces. Be sure to bring a camera or your smart phone. We will be
            capturing and chronicling our experiences as we go along.
          </p>

          <p>
            Workshop: Back from the field, we will convene at Ernst Cafe and
            dive into addressing the design challenge we witnessed and turn
            our observations into actionable insight to help guide strategy
            and design!
